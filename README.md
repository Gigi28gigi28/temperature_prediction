# Temperature Prediction using Time Series Models

This project focuses on predicting temperature values using classical machine learning
and deep learning models applied to time series data.

## Techniques Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Objective
Compare traditional ML models with deep learning approaches for temperature prediction
and analyze their performance on temporal data.
